# On-Kernel-Design-for-Regularized-Non-Causal-System-Identification
- Here provides the formula of NCSI kernel for the Automatica paper ``On Kernel Design for Regularized  Non-Causal System Identification'', see 
[the link to the preprint version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13999 "On Kernel Design for Regularized  Non-Causal System Identification")

- main ncsi_kernel.m
- tc_kernel_SI_bs_test3.m (equivalent to tc_kernel_SI_bs.m) is the file consistent with the paper's notations, but it is not efficient. (tc_kernel_SI_bs.m is more efficient)
